  <h1>Product Photography: Carp Rig</h1>

  <section class="case-study">
<span class="case-label">Article</span>

    <h2>Why this rig, why I photographed it</h2>

    <p>
      During lockdown I started getting into photography. We weren’t allowed to go far or do much, so I ended up
      spending time experimenting at home and quickly found myself enjoying product photography.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fishing has always been part of my life, so using fishing tackle as a subject just made sense. I already knew
      the gear, how it should look, and what mattered. It felt natural to combine something I already loved with
      something new I was learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      This photo is the final image straight from the camera. It hasn’t been edited or cleaned up. I tied the rig
      as I would normally fish it and photographed it simply, focusing on light and detail rather than trying to
      make it look perfect.
    </p>

    <p>The rig itself is made up of:</p>

    <ul class="rig-components">
      <li><a href="#">Korda size 6 micro-barbed curve shank hook</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Micro rig swivel</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">15lb Korda IQ2 fluorocarbon</a></li>
    </ul>
