  <h2>Kingfisher on a Carp Rod</h2>

  <p>
    I was on a local water doing a 72-hour session when something happened that I’ll probably never forget.
  </p>

  <p>
    About 24 hours in, I woke up early — around 6am. It was quiet, cold, and still. I sat up on the bedchair
    and put the kettle on for porridge (I don’t drink brews), just taking in the morning.
  </p>

  <p>
    Out of nowhere, a kingfisher flew past me and landed in a tree further along the bank.
  </p>

  <p>
    I stayed completely still and just watched. After a short while, it took off again — and landed straight
    on one of my carp rods.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the next 45 minutes or so, it kept diving into the lake, coming back with small fish, using my rod to
    dispatch them before swallowing them. It didn’t seem bothered by me at all. At one point there were
    actually <strong>three kingfishers</strong> hopping between my rods. It felt unreal, like something you
    wouldn’t believe if you hadn’t seen it yourself.
  </p>

  <p>
    The next morning I set my alarm for 5:15am. It was still dark, but that’s what I wanted. I set my camera
    up directly behind the rods and tethered it wirelessly to my iPad. One of the things I love about the
    Canon EOS RP is being able to control everything remotely, so I could hide back in the bivvy without
    disturbing anything.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kettle on again, I watched dawn slowly break over the lake, hoping they’d return.
  </p>

  <p>
    At about 6:30am they did.
  </p>

  <p>
    This photo is one of many from that morning — a quiet moment where everything just came together.
