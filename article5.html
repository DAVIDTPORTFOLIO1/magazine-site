  <h2>Great Crested Grebe</h2>

  <p>
    This photo is of a great crested grebe, a bird I’ve always thought was
    particularly beautiful.
  </p>

  <p>
    They sit low in the water and when they dive it all feels very smooth
    and deliberate, almost effortless.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m lucky on my syndicate to have a few breeding pairs, so I get to
    watch them regularly while I’m waiting for a rod to spring into life.
  </p>

  <p>
    Those quiet moments, just watching what’s happening on the lake,
    are a big part of why I enjoy being there.
