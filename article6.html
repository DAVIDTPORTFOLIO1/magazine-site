  <h2>Great Crested Grebe and Chick</h2>

  <p>
    This final image shows a great crested grebe heading away from me with
    one of its young close behind.
  </p>

  <p>
    The adult bird has a crayfish in her beak, and the youngster is clearly
    keen to get hold of it. A small wave on the lake happens to obscure the
    lower part of the birds, which I quite like — it adds to the feeling of
    movement and distance.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’d actually just woken up from an afternoon nap (we all have them) when
    I noticed the grebes and their young right in front of my peg. The adults
    seemed to be catching something and passing it back and forth.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was only when I grabbed the camera and put on a long lens — a Sigma
    150–600 — that I realised they were feeding on crayfish.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moments like this are easy to miss, which makes catching them all the
    more rewarding.
