  <h2>An Unplanned Moment</h2>

  <p>
    This photo was never planned.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was just sitting by the lake, minding my own business, when I happened to look up and noticed
    something that felt a bit out of place. Not in a bad way — just unusual enough to catch my attention.
  </p>

  <p>
    A seagull was sat on a single plank of wood, floating quietly on the lake.
  </p>

  <p>
    There was no drama to it. No movement, no noise. It was just there, almost as if it had chosen
    that exact spot on purpose.
  </p>

  <p>
    I grabbed the camera and took the shot straight away. One of those times where you don’t think,
    you just react.
  </p>

  <p>
    Looking back, that’s probably why I like this image so much. It wasn’t staged or waited for.
    It was just a moment you’d normally glance at and move on from.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes the photos you don’t plan are the ones that stick with you the most.
