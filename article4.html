  <h2>Rods by the Water</h2>

  <p>
    At first glance this is just a simple shot of rods by the water.
  </p>

  <p>
    There was no big idea behind it and nothing particularly planned.
    I just liked the scene and took the photo.
  </p>

  <p>
    What makes it interesting to me is the narrow depth of field.
    When I look at it now, my eyes don’t immediately settle on one rod.
  </p>

  <p>
    It almost feels slightly confusing, like you’re not quite sure
    which part of the image you’re meant to focus on.
  </p>

  <p>
    That wasn’t intentional at the time, but I think that’s why the photo works.
    It makes you pause for a second instead of just glancing and moving on.
